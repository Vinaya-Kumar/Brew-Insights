# Brew Insights

## Project Overview
This project involves creating a comprehensive database for the fictional company Bean Stream, populating it with synthetic data, and then utilizing Power BI for data visualization. Bean Stream specializes in selling coffee beans, ground coffee, and coffee pods across Scandinavian countries. The aim is to provide insights into their operations through detailed data analysis and visualization.
